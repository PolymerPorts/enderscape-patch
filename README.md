# Polymer Patch for Enderscape
This is a patch for [Enderscape](https://modrinth.com/mod/enderscape),
making it work fully server side, with all of its functionality intact.

Enderscape is required and not included within this mod.

Note that unlike some other existing Polymer Patches / Ports, this one requires usage of many visually equal states to create custom blocks.
Which in turn might make it not work if enough Polymer mods using the same functionality is installed alongside it.

This mod requires server resource pack, about which setup you can read here: https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/
