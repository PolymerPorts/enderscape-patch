# Polymer Patch for Enderscape
This is a patch for [Enderscape](https://modrinth.com/mod/enderscape),
making it work fully server side, with all of its functionality intact.

Enderscape is required and not included within this mod.

Note that unlike some other existing Polymer Patches / Ports, this one requires you to have some "free states" provided by Polymer Blocks library.
Since these have limited available amount, if you install enough mods using this feature (or just one that uses all the states), this mod might not work,
or the blocks will require way more resources to run.

This mod requires server resource pack, about which setup you can read here: https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/
